### üîç Introduction

In the age of rapid digital transformation, Bangladesh stands at a critical juncture in shaping a secure, inclusive, and resilient cyberspace. While the **Digital Security Act (DSA) 2018** laid foundational elements, it faces widespread criticism for vague definitions and potential abuse. This paper proposes reformative legal strategies based on leading global examples to help Bangladesh achieve a rights-respecting and innovation-friendly digital future.
